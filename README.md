# Chainvote Corporate Governance on Solana

> DAOs are the new form of Corporate Governance.   Our project is to build an environment of trust, transparency, and accountability on Solana’s fast, secure, and censorship-resistant blockchain platform. Using a Solana smart contract the Corporate Secretary is able to publish an agenda with proposals to bring before the board and voting members.  When publishing the proposal the smart contract will send voting members the SOL voting token(s) to their wallet, automating notification for new items to review for voting. Using the Chainvote Daap Voting members can see the proposals and use SOL token to cast their vote, (1) SOL token = (1) vote.

# Overview

Companies are responsible for having appropriate governance structures that serve the interests of shareholders, key stakeholders, and corporate stewards. We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to the fiduciary responsibilities of these vested parties. Companies and their boards should be accountable to shareholders with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they operate in shareholders’ best interests to create sustainable value. Shareholder’s responsibilities include the right to vote on proposed ballot measures, director appointments and removals, amend the corporate charter or by-laws, and significant changes to the business.  We believe this responsibility should be anchored on accurate and timely information and that shareholder voting rights are proportionate to ownership and independently verified.  Corporate stewards have the responsibility to administer, oversee, and continuously improve company reporting and disclosures, participant engagement, and sustainable long-term value creation.  To that end, our project provides an intuitive, interactive, and secure Dapp to manage the dynamic needs for effective Corporate Governance.
